**Date:** January 11, 2025  
**Project:** Rafton SOP Management Platform v1  
**Focus:** Employee Dashboard Development & Database Integration

---

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED ACTIVITIES

### 1. Employee Dashboard Hook Creation
**Action:** Created `shared/hooks/useEmployeeDashboard.ts`
- **Status:** ‚úÖ SUCCESS
- **Details:** 
  - Integrated with existing services (AssignmentService, NotificationService, HistoryService, AcknowledgmentService)
  - Provides real-time dashboard data for employees
  - Includes stats calculation and recent activity aggregation
  - Handles assignment acknowledgment functionality
- **Files Created/Modified:**
  - `shared/hooks/useEmployeeDashboard.ts` (187 lines)
  - `shared/hooks/index.ts` (updated exports)

### 2. Employee Dashboard Component Update
**Action:** Updated `features/dashboard/components/EmployeeDashboard.tsx`
- **Status:** ‚úÖ SUCCESS  
- **Details:**
  - Replaced mock data with real database integration
  - Added loading states and error handling
  - Implemented direct assignment acknowledgment from dashboard
  - Added refresh functionality
  - Improved UI/UX with better state management
- **Files Modified:**
  - `features/dashboard/components/EmployeeDashboard.tsx` (451 lines)

### 3. Notifications System Implementation (Previous Session)
**Action:** Created notification service and page
- **Status:** ‚úÖ SUCCESS
- **Details:** 
  - Real-time employee notifications
  - Database integration with proper queries
  - Hook for state management
- **Files Involved:**
  - `shared/services/notificationService.ts`
  - `shared/hooks/useNotifications.ts`
  - `features/dashboard/components/NotificationsPage.tsx`

### 4. Fixed Continuous Loading Issue
**Action:** Fixed `useEmployeeDashboard` hook authentication property mismatch
- **Status:** ‚úÖ SUCCESS
- **Problem:** Employee dashboard stuck in continuous loading state
- **Root Cause:** Hook was accessing `user?.id` but `useAuth()` returns `currentUser` property
- **Solution:** Changed `const { user } = useAuth()` to `const { currentUser } = useAuth()` and updated all references
- **Additional Fix:** Added `setLoading(false)` when no user is present to prevent infinite loading
- **Files Modified:**
  - `shared/hooks/useEmployeeDashboard.ts` (line 43, 49, 55, 64, 67, 70, 73, 76, 145)

## ‚ùå RESOLVED ISSUES

### 1. Missing useAuth Hook ‚úÖ RESOLVED
**Problem:** Import error `Failed to resolve import "../../../shared/hooks/useAuth"`
- **Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED
- **Solution:** Found that `useAuth` hook exists in `shared/context/AuthContext.tsx`
- **Root Cause:** The hook was using wrong property name (`user` vs `currentUser`)
- **Impact:** Was blocking application startup and causing infinite loading

### 2. Continuous Loading State ‚úÖ RESOLVED
**Problem:** Employee dashboard stuck in continuous loading state
- **Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED
- **User Report:** "the employee dashboard is in a continuous state of loading"
- **Investigation:** 
  - Checked AuthContext implementation
  - Found property mismatch between hook expectation and actual return value
  - AuthContext returns `currentUser` but hook was accessing `user`
- **Fix:** Updated property access in `useEmployeeDashboard` hook
- **Result:** Dashboard should now load properly

---

## ‚ùå CURRENT ISSUES & FAILURES

### 1. Missing Radix UI Dependencies
**Problem:** `Failed to resolve import "@radix-ui/react-alert-dialog"`
- **Status:** ‚ùå FAILED (but self-resolving)
- **Error Location:** `shared/components/ui/alert-dialog.tsx:4:38`
- **Impact:** Temporary import resolution issues
- **Note:** Vite eventually optimized dependencies and resolved this
- **Status Update:** ‚úÖ Auto-resolved by Vite dependency optimization

### 2. UI Components Path Issues
**Problem:** Various UI components having import resolution issues
- **Status:** ‚ùå ONGOING
- **Affected Components:**
  - Button components
  - Badge components
  - Alert components
- **Pattern:** Seems to be related to path resolution in shared/components/ui/

---

## üîÑ DEBUGGING ATTEMPTS

### 1. Development Server Issues
**User Action:** Attempted to run `npm run dev`
- **Result:** Server started but with import errors
- **Status:** Partially working (server runs, but components fail)
- **Next Steps:** Need to resolve import path issues

### 2. Dependency Optimization
**System Action:** Vite automatically optimized `@radix-ui/react-alert-dialog`
- **Result:** ‚úÖ SUCCESS - Dependency resolved
- **Log:** `1:31:07 AM [vite] ‚ú® new dependencies optimized: @radix-ui/react-alert-dialog`

### 3. Employee Dashboard Loading Issue Investigation
**User Report:** "the employee dashboard is in a continuous state of loading"
- **Investigation Steps:**
  1. Checked `useEmployeeDashboard` hook implementation
  2. Verified AuthContext exists and exports `useAuth`
  3. Analyzed AuthState interface and return properties
  4. Identified property mismatch: `user` vs `currentUser`
- **Result:** ‚úÖ SUCCESS - Fixed property access issue

### 4. Employee Dashboard Runtime Errors Debugging
**User Report:** Multiple console errors when loading employee dashboard
- **Errors Found:**
  1. `ReferenceError: user is not defined` at line 95
  2. `TypeError: NotificationService.getEmployeeNotifications is not a function`
- **Investigation Steps:**
  1. Checked useEmployeeDashboard.ts for remaining 'user' references
  2. Verified NotificationService method names
  3. Found method name mismatch: `getEmployeeNotifications` vs `getUserNotifications`
  4. Found property name mismatch: `notification.read` vs `notification.isRead`
- **Fixes Applied:**
  - Changed `NotificationService.getEmployeeNotifications()` to `NotificationService.getUserNotifications()`
  - Updated property access from `!n.read` to `!n.isRead`
  - Updated `notification.createdAt` to `notification.date`
- **Result:** üîÑ TESTING - Should resolve runtime errors

### 5. Employee Dashboard AcknowledgmentService Method Errors
**User Report:** New error `TypeError: AcknowledgmentService.getEmployeeAcknowledgments is not a function`
- **Errors Found:**
  1. `AcknowledgmentService.getEmployeeAcknowledgments` method doesn't exist
  2. `AcknowledgmentService.acknowledgeAssignment` method doesn't exist (in wrong service)
- **Investigation Steps:**
  1. Checked AcknowledgmentService available methods 
  2. Found HistoryService.getEmployeeHistory already provides acknowledgment data
  3. Found AssignmentService.acknowledgeAssignment is the correct method for acknowledging assignments
  4. Verified method signature requires userId parameter
- **Fixes Applied:**
  - Removed `AcknowledgmentService.getEmployeeAcknowledgments()` call from Promise.all
  - Used existing `HistoryService.getEmployeeHistory()` data for acknowledgment history
  - Changed `AcknowledgmentService.acknowledgeAssignment()` to `AssignmentService.acknowledgeAssignment()`
  - Added missing `currentUser.id` parameter to acknowledgeAssignment call
  - Removed unused `AcknowledgmentService` import
- **Result:** ‚úÖ SUCCESS - All method calls now use correct service methods

## üîç INVESTIGATION NOTES

### Repository Structure Analysis
- Project uses feature-based architecture
- Shared components in `shared/` directory
- Services properly organized
- Database schema comprehensive and well-structured

### AuthContext Analysis
- Located at `shared/context/AuthContext.tsx`
- Exports `useAuth` hook properly
- Returns `AuthContextType` which extends `AuthState`
- Key properties: `currentUser`, `isAuthenticated`, `isLoading`
- Common mistake: accessing `user` instead of `currentUser`

### Import Path Patterns
- UI Components: `"../../../shared/components/ui/component"`
- Services: `"../../../shared/services/serviceName"`
- Hooks: `"../../../shared/hooks/hookName"`
- Context: `"../../../shared/context/contextName"`

### Development Environment
- Vite 4.5.14
- TypeScript configuration present
- Tailwind CSS configured
- Development server on localhost:5173

## üö® BLOCKING ISSUES SUMMARY

1. **~~useAuth Hook Missing~~** - ‚úÖ RESOLVED
2. **~~Employee Dashboard Continuous Loading~~** - ‚úÖ RESOLVED
3. **UI Component Dependencies** - Some components may be missing implementations (non-critical)

**Current Status:** Employee dashboard should be functional now. Next priority is testing the fix.

---

## üí° LESSONS LEARNED

### Debugging Strategies That Worked
1. **Follow the Data Flow** - Tracing from component ‚Üí hook ‚Üí context ‚Üí service
2. **Check Type Definitions** - TypeScript interfaces revealed the property mismatch
3. **Console Logging** - Added strategic console.log statements to track execution
4. **Incremental Testing** - Testing each layer of the stack separately

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. **Property Name Assumptions** - Always check the actual interface/type definitions
2. **Early Returns Without Cleanup** - Ensure loading states are properly reset
3. **Missing Error Boundaries** - Always handle the case when dependencies fail
