## ‚ùå CURRENT ISSUES & FAILURES

### 1. Missing useAuth Hook
**Problem:** Import error `Failed to resolve import "../../../shared/hooks/useAuth"`
- **Status:** ‚ùå FAILED
- **Error Location:** 
  - `features/dashboard/components/TeamManagement.tsx:4:24`
  - `shared/hooks/useTeams.ts`
- **Impact:** Blocking application startup
- **Root Cause:** `useAuth` hook doesn't exist in the expected location
- **Next Steps:** Need to create `useAuth` hook or fix import paths

### 2. Missing Radix UI Dependencies
**Problem:** `Failed to resolve import "@radix-ui/react-alert-dialog"`
- **Status:** ‚ùå FAILED (but self-resolving)
- **Error Location:** `shared/components/ui/alert-dialog.tsx:4:38`
- **Impact:** Temporary import resolution issues
- **Note:** Vite eventually optimized dependencies and resolved this
- **Status Update:** ‚úÖ Auto-resolved by Vite dependency optimization

### 3. UI Components Path Issues
**Problem:** Various UI components having import resolution issues
- **Status:** ‚ùå ONGOING
- **Affected Components:**
  - Button components
  - Badge components
  - Alert components
- **Pattern:** Seems to be related to path resolution in shared/components/ui/

## üîÑ DEBUGGING ATTEMPTS

### 1. Development Server Issues
**User Action:** Attempted to run `npm run dev`
- **Result:** Server started but with import errors
- **Status:** Partially working (server runs, but components fail)
- **Next Steps:** Need to resolve import path issues

### 2. Dependency Optimization
**System Action:** Vite automatically optimized `@radix-ui/react-alert-dialog`
- **Result:** ‚úÖ SUCCESS - Dependency resolved
- **Log:** `1:31:07 AM [vite] ‚ú® new dependencies optimized: @radix-ui/react-alert-dialog`

## üìã TODO - IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES

### High Priority
1. **Fix useAuth Hook Issue**
   - Create missing `useAuth` hook or fix import paths
   - Locate existing auth context/hook implementation
   - Update all components using `useAuth`

2. **Resolve UI Component Import Issues**
   - Verify all UI component paths in `shared/components/ui/`
   - Check if components are properly exported
   - Fix any missing component implementations

3. **Test Employee Dashboard**
   - Once import issues are resolved, test the new employee dashboard
   - Verify database connections work properly
   - Test acknowledgment functionality

### Medium Priority
1. **Complete Database Integration Testing**
   - Test all CRUD operations
   - Verify real-time updates work
   - Test error handling scenarios

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Review Tailwind CSS configuration (current warning about node_modules pattern)
   - Optimize component re-renders

---

## üéØ SUCCESS PATTERNS

### What Works Well
1. **Service Layer Architecture** - Clean separation of concerns
2. **Hook-based State Management** - Consistent pattern across components
3. **TypeScript Integration** - Strong typing throughout
4. **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error states in components
5. **Loading States** - Good UX with loading indicators

### Effective Approaches
1. **Parallel Development** - Creating services and hooks simultaneously
2. **Real Data Integration** - Moving away from mock data quickly
3. **Component Composition** - Reusable UI components
4. **Database-First Design** - Leveraging the comprehensive schema

## üìä METRICS & PROGRESS

### Files Created: 2
- `shared/hooks/useEmployeeDashboard.ts`
- `AI_ACTIVITY_LOG.md`

### Files Modified: 2
- `features/dashboard/components/EmployeeDashboard.tsx`

## üîç INVESTIGATION NOTES

### Repository Structure Analysis
- Project uses feature-based architecture
- Shared components in `shared/` directory
- Services properly organized
- Database schema comprehensive and well-structured

### Import Path Patterns
- UI Components: `"../../../shared/components/ui/component"`
- Services: `"../../../shared/services/serviceName"`
- Hooks: `"../../../shared/hooks/hookName"`
- Context: `"../../../shared/context/contextName"`

### Development Environment
- Vite 4.5.14
- TypeScript configuration present
- Tailwind CSS configured
- Development server on localhost:5173

## üö® BLOCKING ISSUES SUMMARY

1. **useAuth Hook Missing** - Critical for authentication flow
2. **Import Path Resolution** - Affecting multiple components
3. **UI Component Dependencies** - Some components may be missing implementations

**Next Session Priority:** Resolve import issues before proceeding with new features.
